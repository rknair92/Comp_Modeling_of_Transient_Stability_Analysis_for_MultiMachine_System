# Introduction

Power systems are subjected to wide range of disturbances, they can be small disturbances like
variation in load and changes in generation, changes to the network like taking a line out and
large disturbances due to different faults. They are susceptible to different kinds of fault that
test the stability of the system. These faults can result to loss of synchronism or an unstable
operating condition called out of step.

While studying the power system stability conditions, we always consider a fault condition
that can lead the system to an out of step condition. We usually isolate the faulted location/area
to bring the rest of the system to a new stable operating condition. A power system is usually
a large interconnected network that typically features long distance and multi-zone
interconnection. Hence the consequence of out of step may lead to a cascading effect leading
to the collapse of the entire system.

Therefore, it requires an extensive study of the system that requires fault simulation at various
nodes/buses to observe the stability of the system. The fault clearance time is the most
important criteria to determine the stability. To perform fault simulations, we consider the
most severe fault which is the 3-phase fault in studying the power swing and stability. This
analysis can be helpful in designing a protective scheme that helps to prevent premature
tripping. This thereby allow the natural ability of the system to return to its stable condition.
The effect of power swing may lead to nuisance tripping of distance relay. Such tripping is
caused due to Power Swings. Power Swings may be defined as an oscillation in active and
reactive power flow on a transmission line caused by a large disturbance, like a fault. The relay
will issue a trip decision on Power Swing if the impedance trajectory enters the relay zone, to
stay there for a sufficient long time. This kind of tripping during power swings is not desirable.
Power system is a highly nonlinear system and the stability study involves nonlinear dynamics
of a large equation. The synchronous machine has mass and all machines rotate at synchronous
speed. During a disturbance, the operation happens to be at some other point. The change in
operation point depend upon the system. A large disturbance for a long time can lead to loss
of stability for the entire system.

## Power System Stability Analysis
Power system stability can be defined as the ability of the system to return to its steady state
without losing its synchronism when subjected to a disturbance. Disturbances can be small or
large depending on their origin. Power system stability analysis is categorized into:
1. Steady State Stability studies involves the study of power system under small changes or
variations in parameters or the system operating conditions.
2. Transient Stability involves the study of the power system following a major disturbance like
loss of generator units, fault in transmission system, sudden changes of load etc.
3. Dynamic Stability involves the study of power system to maintain stability if subjected to
continuous small disturbances such as generator and load fluctuations.
In all the stability analysis the main objective is to determine whether or not the rotors of the
machines returned to constant speed after being subjected to disturbance. For all stability analysis
to facilitate computation three assumptions are made:
1. DC offset currents and harmonics are neglected i.e. only synchronous frequency currents and
voltages are considered.
2. Symmetrical components are used for representing unbalanced faults.
3. Generated voltage is unaffected by machine speed variations.
